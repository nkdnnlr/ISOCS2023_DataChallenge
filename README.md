# ISOCS2023_DataChallenge

The 2023 International Society for Olfaction and Chemical Sensing (ISOCS) [Winter School](https://www.olfactionsociety.org/event/wintercourse2023/) hosted a data challenge, in which electronic nose representations of different odours should first be learned, and then odour presentations be detected and classified. This repository hosts the code for an approach that won the 1st prize of the challenge. 

For running the code, please install first the dependencies described in [datascience.yml](datascience.yml). Alternatively, run the following command:
```bash
conda env create -f datascience.yml
```

Then, follow the steps and elaborations in [this jupyter notebook](odour_detection.ipynb).
