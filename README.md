# ISOCS2023_DataChallenge

The 2023 International Society for Olfaction and Chemical Sensing (ISOCS) [Winter School](https://www.olfactionsociety.org/event/wintercourse2023/), together with [ellona](https://www.ellona.io/), hosted a data challenge, in which electronic nose representations of different odours should first be learned, and then odour presentations be detected and classified. This repository hosts the code for an approach that won the 1st prize of the challenge. 

For following the approach, please refer to [this jupyter notebook](odour_detection.ipynb).

If you want to modify and/or run the code yourself, please first install the dependencies described in [datascience.yml](datascience.yml). Alternatively, run the following command:
```bash
conda env create -f datascience.yml
```
